## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Muted teal (#73A7A7) to convey a sense of calm, cooperation, and trust. Teal is a balanced blend of blue and green, colors associated with stability and growth.
- Background color: Light, desaturated teal (#E0F0F0) that provides a clean and unobtrusive backdrop, complementing the primary color.
- Accent color: Soft orange (#D9884B) to highlight calls to action and important interactive elements; it is far enough from the primary color in brightness and saturation to catch the eye.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern, readable, and accessible feel.
- Clean, minimal design using clear sections and legible formatting, inspired by legal documents; optimized for both mobile and desktop views using a responsive grid.
- Use simple, professional icons for key sections such as Financial Terms, Utilities, Chores, and Policies to guide users through the form.
- Subtle transitions and feedback animations on form elements (e.g., button presses) to improve user experience and provide visual confirmation of actions.
